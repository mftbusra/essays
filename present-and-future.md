## Nuclear Power and geopolitics



#### Why is nuclear power moving towards Asia when Europe is backing out after the Chornobyl accident?(is it development/pre-caution or future concern?  {href=#}

For Asian countries, they are mostly leaning towards nuclear energy from their economics and increasing their energy demands perspective. Also nuclear power is green energy and sustainable for the environment as a lot of asian countries are depended on fossil fuel energy and they are going under the minimum percentage of forest a country should have. So, with growing industries and populations,if nuclear power is handled with proper precaution, it is the most consistent energy option for their overall energy mix to ensure energy security and meet their rising electricity needs.

However, it is noteworthy that nuclear power is not entirely absent in Europe. Countries like France and Sweden,still heavily rely on nuclear energy for electricity. Also, some countries are embracing advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors and fusion, hoping to lead to a reevaluation of nuclear power in the future.

There might be two reasons behind this.

1.Western Europe’s Nuclear Need
2.Eastern Europe’s Nuclear Conflicts

Germany : All the NPPs are shut down (most recently by April 2023).

Italy :  After 1986 rejected all plans.
         In 2007 Was thinking about a restoration attempt 
         In 2011 banned the use of nuclear power as the result of a referendum.

Austria : In 1978, held a referendum on building an NPP, the citizens voted against nuclear power, never operated. 
          In the 1960s, three small nuclear reactors were built for scientific purposes, and only one of these plants 
          is still being operated.

Switzerland :  In 1990, held a referendum, citizens supported a ten-year moratorium on building new NPPs, but the 
               four existing plants continued in operation. 
               In 2017, the Swiss government rejected the construction of new NPPs.

UK : have plans to close all the NPPs by 2035.

Belgium : have plans to close most of the NPPs by 2025, others by 2035.

France :  68% of the country's annual electricity generation comes from NPPs.

Netherlands : one NPP reactor in operation, one NPP in safe enclosure, two research reactors, one enrichment plant

Ireland : In 1999, electricity produced by nuclear fission was banned.


Russia : In 1987–2000, stopped building NPPs.
         In the twenty-first century, Russia resumed the use of nuclear energy, Rosatom corporation consists of 360 
         enterprises and currently building NPPs in twelve countries.

Belarus : has returned to the use of NPPs. 
          In 2021, the first Belarusian NPP operated.
          By 2023, another NPP will start operating.

Lithuania : closed its NPP (the sole source of 70 percent of its electricity)

Poland : In the 1990 referendum, 86 percent of citizens voted against the use of nuclear power. 
         proposal of own NPP in operation by 2030.

The Czech Republic : has six reactors in operation and more in future.

Slovakia : active four nuclear reactors.
           In 2004, had to close two reactors as a condition of joining the EU.

Ukraine : more than half the electricity produced from NPPs.



The Chernobyl disaster majorly impacted on Europe's perception of nuclear power. EU is concerned about the safety of nuclear reactors and their potential for catastrophic consequences. Phasing out or reduce their reliance on nuclear power was influenced by public sentiment, political factors, and a desire to prioritize other alternative energy sources such as renewable energy. Long-term environmental impact of nuclear power played a role as well. Issues such as radioactive waste disposal, the risk of accidents, and the potential for nuclear proliferation have raised questions about the sustainability and desirability of nuclear energy.

####Is this the reason why Asia is not interested in Russian-Ukrainian war?


The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is geographically distant from most Asian countries, and their immediate security concerns might be focused somewhere else. It's also true that the Russian-Ukrainian war has impacted global security and geopolitics, and some Asian countries' interests lies in the outcome (like China shares a border with Russia). 
Again economic or political ties (foreign policy objectives) to either Russia or Ukraine impacted the support for each country. Countries with significant trade or investment links to either country tends to have a stronger incentive to monitor the situation closely due to potential economic repercussions.



####Comparison with the Zaporizhzhya NPP that is currently playing a role in the Russian-Ukrainian warfare; comparison with Fukushima in how it’s handled & aftermath.


As Zaporizhzhia NPP was taken over by russian army. With continued shelling around the plant repeatedly cutting access to the electricity grid, it's last working reactor were planned to shut down. A stable electricity supply is important for any nuclear power plant to maintain cooling systems for radioactive fuel. Zaporizhzhia does have diesel generators to switch on when the primary electricity supply is cut, but they are not a long-term solution. The exact situation of not having continuous electricity to run the reactor worsened the situation of Chornobyl in the past, and also at Fukushima for the earthquake. Disaster at Zaporizhzhia, caused either by an accident or a deliberate attack, residents in Ukrainian towns and villages nearby could face the threat of radiation poisoning immediately or within a few hours.

#### Description 
Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ BAR-sə-LOH-nə, Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə], Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona]) is a city on the coast of northeastern Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.

Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many international sport tournaments.

Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).

Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.
